This project is able to accept a NUMBER (non-letter, non-decimal, non-negative number and non-zero)

It then sends a request for the server to create a Fibionacci Sequence. A second page is displayed 
with the job number and result. the result will remain 'null' untill the page refreshes sending another 
request to the server. When the page recieves teh result of the seqence it will then jump to a 3rd page
showing the sequence.
